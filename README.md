### Hey! I'm David but you can call me Dave! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Spatial Data Scientist from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ living in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I'm the creator of **[eemont](https://github.com/davemlz/eemont), [spectral](https://github.com/davemlz/spectral), [spyndex](https://github.com/davemlz/spyndex)** and co-creator of **[eeExtra](https://github.com/r-earthengine/ee_extra)** (with the incredible [@csaybar](https://github.com/csaybar)).

Currently, I'm a **Research Assistant** at the [Remote Sensing Centre for Earth System Research (RSC4Earth)](https://rsc4earth.de/) and a **PhD Student** at the University of Leipzig (Leipzig, Germany). I have a **MSc in Data Science** from the University of Cantabria (Santander, Spain) and a **BEng in Topographic Engineering** from the University of Valle (Cali, Colombia).

> NOTE: If you want, you can ask me about Remote Sensing, Data Science, Google Earth Engine and Memes :) ... and that was it, stay safe and don't die! Below I let you a list of the projects I'm working on right now if you need more info!
