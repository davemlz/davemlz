### Hey! I'm David but you can call me Dave ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**davemlz/davemlz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Topographic Engineer (University of Valle, Cali, CO) and a Master in Data Science (University of Cantabria, Santander, ES). I'm passionate about **Remote Sensing** and **Data Science**, and those are my main research interests, followed by **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Geomatics**, **GIS** an related areas.

- I'm currently working on a Python package for making Google Earth Engine easier (I know it already is, but I want it more!). So, stay tuned!
- Ask me about Remote Sensing and Google Earth Engine, maybe I can help!

That was it, stay safe!
