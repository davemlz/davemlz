### Hey! I'm David but you can call me Dave! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Topographic Engineer (University of Valle, Cali, CO) and a Master in Data Science (University of Cantabria, Santander, ES). I'm passionate about **Remote Sensing** and **Data Science**, and those are my main research interests, followed by **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Geomatics**, **GIS** and related areas.

PD: Ask me about Remote Sensing and Google Earth Engine, maybe I can help!

That was it, stay safe!
